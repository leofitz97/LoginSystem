# LoginSystem

This is a Login System implemented using reactjs as the frontend and express js as the bweackend server.

In this folder we have the client side which is the reactjs and the server side which is the nodejs and expressjs.

STEPS:
1. First, download or clone this repository.
2. After, open the repository folder in a terminal or command line.
3. Go to client using the terminal and type "npm start" to start the reactjs development server.
4. The default browser will open and you'll see the application.

5. On the terminal, go back with "cd.." (this is a linux terminal command).
6. Go to the server folder using the terminal and type "nodemon index.js" to start the server.

Now you're ready to use the login system.

Thank you...



This login system contains the usual functionalities of resetting a forgotten password, remember me option, sigin and signup.

Express session is used for session management in when a user signs in and logout.
